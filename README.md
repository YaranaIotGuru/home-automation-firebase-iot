# Home Automation Made Easy: Create Your Own IoT Cloud with a Custom Web Dashboard Using Firebase

Welcome to the **Home Automation Made Easy** project! This repository contains all the necessary files and code to create your own IoT cloud with a custom web dashboard using Firebase. This project is designed to help you set up a home automation system with ease, and includes detailed instructions and code examples.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a home automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller, Firebase for the cloud backend, and a custom web dashboard to control and monitor devices. The web dashboard is built using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS, and all the source files are included in this repository.

## Repository Contents

- **config.php**: Configuration file for Firebase and other settings.
- **controller.php**: Main controller file to handle requests and update the dashboard.
- **footer.php**: Footer section of the web dashboard.
- **header.php**: Header section of the web dashboard.
- **index.php**: Main file for the web dashboard interface.
- **logo.png**: Logo image used in the dashboard.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file to handle dynamic behavior on the dashboard.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the dashboard.
- **code.ino**: ESP32 code for connecting to Firebase and controlling devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you will need the following:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Firebase account
- PHP server to host the web dashboard
- Basic knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, and CSS

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-iot.git
    ```

2. **Firebase Setup**: Set up your Firebase project and obtain the necessary configuration details (API key, project ID, etc.). Update the `config.php` file with these details.

3. **Upload ESP32 Code**: Upload the `code.ino` file to your ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or another suitable tool. Make sure to update the Firebase and Wi-Fi credentials in the code.

4. **Host Web Dashboard**: Host the web dashboard on your PHP server. Ensure all the files are placed in the appropriate directories.

### Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can access the web dashboard through your browser. The dashboard will allow you to monitor and control your home automation devices in real-time.
